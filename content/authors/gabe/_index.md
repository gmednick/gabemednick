During graduate school, I maintained a broad interdisciplinary approach that included microbiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, physical chemistry and spectroscopy. As a postdoc, I developed curriculum and taught biology and chemistry with an emphasis on interactive, inquiry-based learning. In my first role as a lead scientist with a startup, I worked on proprietary DNA and RNA synthesis. These experiences were filled with valuable lessons and hidden blessings. 

My company, Deepen Analytics, provides contracting and consulting services to generate innovative data solutions. I can also be found teaching data science at various universities including Kansas State and San Diego State.
