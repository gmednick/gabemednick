During graduate school, I maintained a broad interdisciplinary approach that included microbiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, physical chemistry and spectroscopy. As a postdoc, I developed curriculum and taught biology and chemistry with an emphasis on interactive, inquiry-based learning. In my first role as a lead scientist with a startup, I worked on proprietary DNA and RNA synthesis. Each of these experiences was filled with valuable lessons and hidden blessings. 

“Hello World!”. My professional development as a data scientist and bioinformatician started out as an effort to expand my scientific toolbox but gradually turned into a whole new tool-:hammer:-:nut_and_bolt:-:wrench:-set-:smile:. I enjoy the challenge of drawing insight from all types of data. Each step of the process, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to creating models, deriving predictions and communicating results is a blend of craft and science. Finding that balance, deriving insight and creating value is what drives my passion as a data scientist.
