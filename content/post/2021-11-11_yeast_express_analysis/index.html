<h2>Yeast microarray data</h2>
<p>In biology, the term ‘omics’ is used to refer to studies that involve a meta view of the behavior of an entire class of molecules. Omics can refer to a range of disciplines, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics. This post will focus on transcriptomics, the field of study that looks at RNA expression and transcriptional regulation in response to specific changes. We will be using gene expression data from <a href="https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.e07-08-0779">Brauer et al, 2008</a>. The title of their paper provides a powerful summary of the experiment and what they learned from the data: ‘Coordination of Growth Rate, Cell Cycle, Stress Response, and Metabolic Activity in Yeast’.</p>
<p>In my last two posts, I have tried to emphasize the use of Bioconductor packages and the Tidyverse in a seamless analysis workflow. Although we may ultimately be working with specialized bioinformatics packages such as <code>Deseq2</code>, <code>EdgeR</code> or <code>Lima</code> for analysis of transcriptomic data, David Robinson notes that ‘Any challenge in plotting, filtering, or merging your data will get directly in the way of answering scientific questions’. This is why the <code>Tidyverse</code> is essential to any analysis workflow.</p>
<p>As noted, the data is from yeast and the gene expression levels were measured under conditions of selective nutrient starvation. Growth rates were also carefully controlled by using a chemostat to regulate the flow of fresh growth media. The expression data was collected using a microarray. Microarrays measure expression levels as fluorescence intensities that are proportional to the number of sequences that bind to the complementary probe sequences of the array. RNA-seq experiments are considered more accurate since all RNA transcripts are counted directly.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the deeps of this analysis, I want to give credit and thanks to David Robinson. David is one of the most insightful and inspiring data scientists on the planet. He has a few courses on DataCamp and regularly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ">livestreams</a> data analysis with R, the Tidyverse and Tidymodels. This post will closely follow a <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics-biobroom/">series of posts</a> by David that focus on working with genomic data.</p>

<h2>Cleaning the data</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve seen the data, let’s talk about how we can make the information more useful by tidying it. A Tidy data frame should have one variable per column and one observation per row. In the Brauer data, the <code>NAME</code> column has multiple pieces of information separated by ‘||’. Similarly, the numeric column names are made up of the nutrient that is being limited in growth media and the growth rate. The respective values are the relative expression levels for each gene under the given conditions. Enough talk, let’s code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># I&#39;m going to pivot the table longer by combining all nutrient conditions into one column and expression values into another. Then we can separate and the information in the above mentioned columns in only a couple of steps using separate()

<p>Cool, let’s explore some of the benefits of Tidying our data? For starters, we can explore the data with the data visualization package, <code>GGplot2</code>. When we cleaned the data, we separated important annotation information about each gene. Let’s use this information to count each category and see what the most common molecular processes in .</p>
<pre class="r"><code># plotting most common gene product associated molecular processes

<p>Let’s also look at the annotation for gene product activity.</p>

<p>Visualizing relationships in our data can help us check for inconsistencies and deepen our intuition about the relationships between variables. For instance, let’s consider how expression levels depend on growth rate for each of the nutrient limiting categories. Genes that show an increase or decrease in expression may be directly affected by the specific nutrient limitation. Let’s start off by looking at a couple of individual genes under each nutrient limiting condition and then expand our visual exploration to look for patterns based on activity or molecular process.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Let&#39;s replace the nutrient symbols with names
nutrients &lt;- c(G = &#39;Glucose&#39;, L = &#39;Leucine&#39;, N = &#39;Nitrogen&#39;, P  = &#39;Phosphate&#39;, S = 
&#39;Sulfate&#39;, N = &#39;Ammonia&#39;, U = &#39;Uracil&#39;)

yeast_df_tidy &lt;- yeast_df_tidy %&gt;% 
  mutate(nutrient = recode(
    nutrient, !!!nutrients
  ))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>yeast_df_tidy %&gt;% 
  select(gene_name, activity, molec_process, nutrient, growth_rate, expression_levels) %&gt;% 
  filter(gene_name == &quot;SUL1&quot;) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(growth_rate, expression_levels, color = nutrient)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = &quot;Expression levels vs growth rate for SUL1&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;SUL1 is involved in sulfate transport&quot;,
       x = &quot;Growth rate&quot;,
       y = &quot;Expression&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Without more information about SUL1, it’s hard to know what we should expect. I would expect it’s activity to increase with growth rate under sulfate limiting conditions (more sulfate present in the media). Instead, it appears to increase wit increasing uracil and phosphate.</p>
<p>This time, let’s try a gene whose protein product is directly involved in the synthesis of a limiting nutrient. For this, we will use LEU1 which is involved in the synthesis of leucine.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>yeast_df_tidy %&gt;% 
  select(gene_name, activity, molec_process, nutrient, growth_rate, expression_levels) %&gt;% 
  filter(gene_name == &quot;LEU1&quot;) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(growth_rate, expression_levels, color = nutrient)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = &quot;Expression levels vs growth rate for LEU1&quot;,
       x = &quot;Growth rate&quot;,
       y = &quot;Expression&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now, we can see a very clear trend: As growth rate increasing (increasing availability of leucine in the growth media) the in-house machinery for leucine biosynthesis is turned down.</p>
<p>Let’s use <code>filter()</code> and <code>facet_wrap()</code> to search for gene products involved in different categories to get a better sense of our data.</p>

<p>FBP26 exhibits a trend of decreasing expression with increasing growth rate. We see that a linear model fits this trend quite well. In th next section we are going to generate linear models for each gene and nutrient combination. Then we will look at how we can visualize significant genes based on whether they were up or down regulated in relation to growth rate.</p>

<h2>Quantifying expression levels with linear regression</h2>
<p>We are going to use base R’s <code>lm()</code> function to estimate the expression for each gene-nutrient combination. This can be done by grouping and nesting the data, then using the <code>purrr</code> package to iterate over the samples and return a linear model for each.

In the previous plot, we used the results from the linear model to visualize the genes with the most positive or negative slopes (estimates) respectively. We also included errorbars to show the 95% confidence intervals.</p>
<p>Let’s create one more visualization to look at the genes with the most positive change in expression in response to growth rate (under one of the nutrient conditions).</p>

<p>Hopefully this post has convinced you that the tidyverse can be the backbone of any omics analysis. It is essential for data cleaning, visualization, generating models and evaluating the results. That said, an important point was made in the comments of David’s post:</p>
<p>“..If you want to do statistical analysis of genomics data it is better to rely on the Bioconductor packages themselves which have been optimized for the characteristics such as small sample sizes relative to the numbers of features.”</p>
<p>In a follow up post, I will use an RNA-seq dataset to show how the <code>tidybulk</code> package can seamlessly bridge the tidyverse with specialized Bioconductor packages such as <code>Deseq2</code>, <code>EdgeR</code> and <code>Lima</code>. Until then, tidy on!</p>
